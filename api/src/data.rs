/*
NOTE HashMaps don't seem to work with poem_openapi ._________.
I tried deriving Object (nope b/c newtype struct), NewType (weird messages about missing FromJSON, FromMultipart etc.).
I even tried switching off various trait derives with
`#[oai(from_json = false, from_parameter = false, from_multipart = false, to_header = false)]` but that made no difference.

Other data structures seem to work (except tuples), and I can give a HashMap directly as a response via
`Json(HashMap<Foo, Bar>)` but _not_ derive any [`poem_openapi::Type`] from it. Maybe it's a bug, maybe not. The only
reason I really tried that anyways was hoping that Swagger would display my response types nicely. Moving onâ€¦
